## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/limbo-game.git
cd limbo-game
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server
```bash

## How to Play

### Manual Mode
1. Enter your bet amount
2. Set your target multiplier
3. Click "Place Bet"
4. Watch the multiplier animate from 1.00x to the result
5. If the result is equal to or higher than your target, you win!

### Auto Mode
1. Configure your betting strategy:
   - Base bet amount
   - Base target multiplier
   - Number of rounds

## Architecture

The game uses a client-server architecture where:

- **Client (Browser)**: Handles the UI, animations, and user interactions
- **Server (Node.js/Express)**: Manages game logic, calculates multipliers, and determines win/loss outcomes
- **crypto.bch.js**: Ensures provably fair game results using HMAC-SHA256 hashing

## Provably Fair System

Our game uses a provably fair system to ensure that all game outcomes are fair and can be verified. Here's how it works:

1. **Seed Generation**: Client and server seeds are generated for each game session
2. **Nonce**: A counter that increments with each bet to ensure unique results
3. **Hashing**: The seeds and nonce are combined using HMAC-SHA256 to generate a random number
4. **Multiplier Calculation**: The random number is converted to a multiplier with a house edge

Players can verify any game result using the client seed, server seed, and nonce, ensuring complete transparency.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Cryptography**: Node.js crypto module (HMAC-SHA256)
- **Styling**: CSS3 with flexbox and grid layouts
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
